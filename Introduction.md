# Introduction

This Project compared the neighborhoods of the two cities(New York City and Toranto) and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. 

Suppose you work in Toronto and you're happy with the neighborhood you live in, but you've got a job offer in New York, and you hope to find a neighborhood in New York with a high degree of similarity, and the results of this project will provide that possibility.
